# Milestone 4: Real-Time Face Detection
This folder contains the implementation of a real-time face detection system that displays bounding boxes and confidence scores.


## Goals
- Optimize the trained classifier for real-time performance using live video feeds or webcam input.
- Display bounding boxes and confidence scores for detected faces in real time.
- Assess the system's real-time accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Results
- Successfully implemented a real-time face detection system, achieving smooth and accurate face tracking on live video feeds.
- Bounding boxes and confidence scores were displayed effectively, with minimal latency.
- Optimization techniques, including downscaling and region of interest processing, ensured reliable real-time performance even on modest hardware.
