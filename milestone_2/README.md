# Milestone 2: Image Integeals and Haar Features
This folder contains the implementation of image integrals and the extraction of Haar features for face detection.

## Goals
- Implement the integral image for efficient computation of Haar-like features.
- Extract Haar features from training images to serve as inputs for the face detection classifier.
- Validate the correctness of the integral image implementation through test cases.

## Results
- Successfully implemented the integral image, significantly reducing the computational cost of feature extraction.
- Extracted a comprehensive set of Haar features from the BioID dataset for use in training.
- Verified the accuracy of the integral image through test cases, ensuring consistency between the original image and the derived features.
