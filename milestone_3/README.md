# Milestone 3: Face Detection Classifier
This folder contains the implementation of a face detection classifier trained using AdaBoost and Haar features.

## Goals
- Train a face detection classifier using AdaBoost to combine weak classifiers into a strong one.
- Use the Haar features extracted in milestone 2 as inputs for the classifier.
- Evaluate the classifier's accuracy and robustness using a subset of the BioID Face Database.

## Results
- Successfully trained a custom face detection classifier with high accuracy on the training dataset.
- Achieved a significant reduction in false positives and false negatives compared to the pretrained Haar Cascade Classifier.
- Evaluated the classifier on unseen test data, confirming its ability to generalize across varied lighting and pose conditions.
